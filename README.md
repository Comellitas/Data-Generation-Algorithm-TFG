## Abstract
This project consists of the improvement of an existing Agent-Based Simulator based on Repast Simphony used to track the water, electricity and gas consumption of a household in Barcelona. This tool, through the simulation of interactions between diverse inhabitants and their environment, aims to provide more precise insights into energy and water usage dynamics for households. My objective is to improve the simulator by the generation of better sampled input data. During this project, I will create a data generation algorithm with Python to provide more accurate, extensive and fair data samples based on the actual data provided by different open data sources. I will be validating the different generation algorithms for the input variables visually and through statistical methods to demonstrate that the generated data represent fairly and accurately the original data. The changes proposed by my project aim at providing an improved and more accurate result that will represent the water and energy consumption habits of the inhabitants of Barcelona.
